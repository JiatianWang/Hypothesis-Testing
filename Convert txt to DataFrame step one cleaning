def get_list_of_university_towns():
    '''Returns a DataFrame of towns and the states they are in from the 
    university_towns.txt list. The format of the DataFrame should be:

    The following cleaning needs to be done:

    1. For "State", removing characters from "[" to the end.
    2. For "RegionName", when applicable, removing every character from " (" to the end.
    3. Depending on how you read the data, you may need to remove newline character '\n'. '''
